**Dharma Dilemma**: Ethical Philosophy Game
Dharma Dilemma is an interactive, AI-powered game that explores the gray areas of morality and ethics through real-world scenarios inspired by philosophy, mythology, and modern dilemmas.

**Purpose**
To spark introspection, deepen ethical reasoning, and expose players to diverse philosophical perspectives — from Kant’s deontology and Utilitarianism to Krishna’s Dharma and Confucian values.

🕹️ **How It Works**
1. Scenario-based Dilemmas
Players face morally complex situations (e.g., workplace corruption, family loyalty vs justice, AI bias).

2. Make a Choice
Two options are presented, forcing the player to weigh values like truth, loyalty, justice, and compassion.

3. Philosophical Feedback
AI (powered by Groq's LLaMA models) responds with what different philosophers might say — e.g.,

Kant: “You acted out of duty.”

Krishna: “Act without attachment to reward.”

Nietzsche: “Did you create your own values?”

4. Reflection & Learning
Players gain insight into ethical theories and are encouraged to reflect on their own decision-making.

**Built With**
1. Frontend: Streamlit (for quick, beautiful UI)

2. AI Engine: Groq API with LLaMA 3 via OpenAI SDK

3. Content: Curated dilemmas + philosophical frameworks
